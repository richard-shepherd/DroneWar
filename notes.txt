Aim
---
- To have something exciting to watch
  - So it needs to play fast
  - Like the drone war in Universal Paperclips



Ideas
-----
- You start by being given n drone-points

- Each drone point can be an individual drone
  or you can create larger drones by combining them

- At each turn, each AI is told the game info:
  - The position and size of each drone
  - The health of each drone (?)

- Larger drones move slower than smaller ones



How should firing at enemies work?
----------------------------------
- Simple idea:
  - You choose an enemy to fire at, and you always hit them
  - The amount of damage is based on the strength of your ship
    (smaller ships do less damage?)
  - The amount of damage works on the inverse square of the distance

- Problems with the simple idea:
  - It makes blocking redundant
  - It makes dodging redundant

- Advantages of the simple idea:
  - It is simple to code (for me and for AIs)
  - It gives an advantage to getting up close to enemies
    - There is an interesting trade-off between firing early
      and waiting to get close before firing

- How often can you fire?
  - Should you be able to fire at every turn?
  - Maybe there should be a recharge time for firing?
    - This would lead to the trade-off between firing early and
      waiting until you are closer


How do large and small drones work?
-----------------------------------
- Say you start with 100 drone points. You can have:
  - 100 small drones
  - 25 x 4-size drones
  - 1 x 100-size drone
  - etc

- It might be tricky to get the balance right between large and small drones
  - To stop there being an obvious advantage to one or the other

- That said, maybe that doesn't really matter too much as people
  will just opt for one or the other
  - But would have been a waste of time coding in the engine

- Should a 4-drone be able to take 4 x the damage of a 1-drone?
  - Should it be more than 4x? (ie, more tank-like)
  - Should it be less than 4x? (ie, diminishing returns to size)

- What damage does a 4-drone deal?
  - Does it have only one gun? (but a more powerful one, eg 4x power)
  - Does it have multiple guns? (if so, does it have 4, or 2?)

- How fast does a 4-drone move?
  - Maybe 1/4 speed of a 1-drone

- QUESTION: Do we even want n-drones?
  - Would it be simpler (and maybe better) to just have 1-drones?
  - Perhaps good to start with 1-drones and see how it goes


Thought about large drones
--------------------------
- Can it ever work to have a large drone?
  - If there is any downside to them

- For example one 20-drone vs twenty 1-drones

- You could alternatively just have the twenty 1-drones, and move
  them all around as if they were a single drone

- If larger drones are slower (for example), then why would you ever have one?

- So larger drones need to have some advantage to offset this


What is the aim of the game?
----------------------------
- To kill all the opponent's drones?

- To capture an opponent's position?

- To capture / kill the opponent's queen?


Optional parameters for drones
------------------------------
- IDEA: You can choose parameters for your drones:
  - Speed
  - Armour
  - LaserStrength

- It could be that you have a total budget, and you can divide it how you like
  between the drones you create

- For example:
  - A standard drone might have:
  - Speed =  100
  - Armour = 100
  - Laser =  100

- So you get 300 points per drone

- So in a game with 100 drones (per team), you get a total of 30000 points

- You can divide this how you like

- Different drones do not have to be the same
  - And you do not have to create the maximum number of drones

- So in a game with max 100 drones, you could create one drone with
  - Speed =  10000
  - Armour = 10000
  - Laser =  10000


Self-repair?
------------
- Should drones self-repair over time?

- If they are not attacked, maybe they regenerate armour back up to the initial value?


Starting configuration
----------------------
- It would be good to have drones start in some sort of intersting configuration

- Better than that they all start in one spot
  - This could look rather boring - especially if they all just go directly for
    each other. Then you might only see one dot!

- Maybe there could be a number of starting configurations:
  - Lined up on the left and right
  - V-formation left and right
  - Randomly distributed


How should moving work?
-----------------------
- It could be that drones can move in any dirction at any time.

- Or it could be that they move like an Asteroids spaceship
  - ie, that you thrust in a direction, and it is added to your
        current vector

- If we use the asteroids-style movement, velocity could increase beyond
  the TopSpeed
  - In fact, this should be renamed to MaxThrust in this case.

- If we use the asteroids-style movement, it could be that controlling velocity
  becomes rather hard
  - So there could be an action in a turn for FULL-STOP
  - This would take the whole turn (though you could still fire)

- Not sure if the asteroids-style movement is a cool idea
  - Or whether it just makes things unnecessarily complicated for AIs
